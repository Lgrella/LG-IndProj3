# Individual Project 3 for Data Engineering Systems

The purpose of this project is to work with the Databricks platform, which is designed for massive-scale data engineering and collaborative data science.

To do this, I created a data pipeline using the Databricks platform. 

I connected my github repository with my databricks workspace and pushed my three notebooks (ingest, prepare, and analyze songs) to this repository.

Below is a screenshot of my visualization: Songs Over Time
